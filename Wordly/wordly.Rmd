## Wordly - a word prediction app

This small app is created for the Data Science Capstone on Coursera.

Source of the data:

Methods used for the model:

Future improvements:
Of course there are many improvements possible for a future release, which I unfortunatly didn't have the time to try and implement here. A couple of suggestions:

- Always collect up to 5 predictions, combined from different n-grams and show them all
- Weigh predictions for best match: now the script assumes that all higher-level n-grams are more probable then lower-level n-grams, but that is not always the case
- Make more robust for non-alphabetic input
- Filter out more profanity words
- Output a wordcloud or some other visual form of output for the user
