### Background

This small app is created for the Data Science Capstone project. This project is the final step in the Data Science Specialization from the Johns Hopkins University.

The original data used in the project can be [downloaded here](https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/dsscapstone/dataset/Coursera-SwiftKey.zip)

### Goal of the app

The goal for this project is to create a 'next word' text prediction model in R, based on data analysis of three different datasets with texts from three different sources:

- blogs
- news
- twitter

### How to use

Just enter one or more words and hit the button: the app will call the prediction algorithm that searches for the best match.

If you want to learn more about the modelling steps performed and the working of the prediction script, open up the **Details** tab.
